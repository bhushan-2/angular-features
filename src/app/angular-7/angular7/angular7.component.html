                  As applications grow in functionality, they also grow in size. Budgets is a feature in the Angular CLI
                  which allows you to set budget thresholds in your configuration to ensure parts of your application
                  stay within boundaries which you set.
                </p>
                <p>Angular budgets allows us to configure expected sizes of these bundles. More so, we can configure
                  thresholds for conditions when we want to receive a warning or even fail build with an error if the
                  bundle size gets too out of control!</p>

                  This is one of the new features added to Angular 7 called as Virtual Scrolling. This feature is added
                  to CDK (Component Development Kit). Virtual scrolling shows up the visible dom elements to the user,
                  as the user scrolls, the next list is displayed. This gives faster experience as the full list is not
                  loaded at one go and only loaded as per the visibility on the screen.
                </p>

                  The @angular/cdk/drag-drop module provides you with a way to easily and declaratively create
                  drag-and-drop interfaces, with support for free dragging, sorting within a list, transferring items
                  between lists, animations, touch devices, custom drag handles, previews, and placeholders, in addition
                  to horizontal lists and locking along an axis.
